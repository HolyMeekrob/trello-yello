/**
 * A recursive function that checks that a property path that is formatted
 * as a string with its properties separated by forward slashes ('/') matches
 * a legal property path as listed within our object maps. The rules are as
 * follows:
 * 1. If we are on the last property in the path, then its allowEmpty field
 * must be set to true.
 * 2. If the next element in the path matches a subproperty of the current
 * property, then we have the following cases:
 * 2(a). If the property does not have an array named allowNext or that array
 * does not include the next element, then return false.
 * 2(b). If allowNext does include the next element, recursively call this
 * function on that property.
 * 3. If the next element in the path does not match a subproperty, then
 * check the property's allowId array. If that array exists, then we have
 * the following cases:
 * 3(a). If the next element is the last element in the path, then allowId
 * must contain the empty string, which signifies that the id can be the last
 * element in the path.
 * 3(b). If the next element is not the last element in the path, then
 * allowId must contain a string that equals the second element in the path.
 * If so, and if a subproperty exists with the name of that second element,
 * then recursively call this function with that subproperty.
 * 3(c). If neither of the above cases are met, return false.
 * @method hasValidPath
 * @param {Object} property the property mappings with the current property
 * as the root object
 * @param {String} remainingPath the remaining path. The first element
 * is the immediate child of the property parameter. If remainingPath is
 * empty, then property is the last element of the path and its validation as
 * such is returned.
 * @return {Boolean} true if the path is valid for the property tree
